  "description": "I would like to make all the logging in the system controllable through a centralized logging library, that way we don't pollute the global logs but have a way to enable debug logging if wanted through some enablement flag. For example https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug uses local storage to decide which log prefix to enable."
