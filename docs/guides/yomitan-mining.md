# Mining words with Yomitan

Subtitle Insights is designed to be a companion to powerful pop-up dictionaries like **Yomitan** (formerly Yomichan). Together, they create a highly efficient workflow for "mining" vocabulary.

## The Workflow

1. **Watch & Discover:** As you watch a video, the AI Insights in the sidebar provide a grammatical overview of the sentence.
2. **Hover for Detail:** If you encounter an unfamiliar word, use **Yomitan** to hover over the Japanese text in either the Overlay or the Sidebar.
3. **Analyze context:** Use the Subtitle Insights translation to understand how the word functions in that specific sentence.
4. **Create Flashcards:** Quickly add the word to Anki via Yomitan's integration.

## Why use both?

- **Yomitan** is excellent for word-level lookups (definitions, pitch accent, kanji).
- **Subtitle Insights** provides the sentence-level "big picture" (grammar structure, cultural nuances, fluid translation).
- **Synergy:** By having both, you never have to guess *why* a word is being used in a specific grammatical form.

## Configuration Tips

- **Sidebar Width:** You can adjust the sidebar width in the extension settings to give yourself more room for Yomitan popups.
- **Pause on Hover:** This feature is especially useful when mining, as it gives you the time to do lookups without having to manually pause the video.
