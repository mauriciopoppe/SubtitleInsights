# Watching on YouTube

YouTube is the primary platform for Subtitle Insights, offering the most integrated experience.

## Workflow

1. **Open a Video:** Navigate to any YouTube video with subtitles (CC).
2. **Enable Subtitles:** Make sure the native YouTube CC is turned ON.
3. **Toggle Insights:** The extension button will appear in the player's control bar (next to the settings gear). Click it to ensure the features you want (Overlay/Sidebar) are enabled.
4. **Interact:**
   - Watch the overlay for real-time translation.
   - Use the sidebar to review complex sentences.
   - Hover over the overlay to pause and digest a difficult line.

## Intensive Mining Workflow

For learners who want to deeply understand every sentence, here is a suggested "Mining" workflow:

### 1. Setup

- **Select Quality Subtitles:** Look for videos with manual Japanese CC (avoid "Auto-generated" when possible for better accuracy).
- **Capture and Hide:** Enable YouTube CC to let Subtitle Insights capture the track. Once the Subtitle Insights overlay appears, you can turn **OFF** the native YouTube CC to avoid visual clutter.
- **Configure Features:** Enable **Translation**, **Insights**, and **Pause on Hover**.

### 2. The Learning Loop

The core of this workflow is a repetitive cycle of listening and analysis:

1. **Shadowing:** Listen to the segment and shadow the pronunciation.
2. **Analysis (Paused):** Use **Pause on Hover** to stop the video automatically when your cursor is over the overlay. This gives you time to:
   - Reread the sentence at your own pace.
   - Study the **AI Insights** to see how particles connect each word and how verbs end.
   - Use the **Yomitan popup** to scan and "mine" specific vocabulary while the video is held.
3. **Review (Replay):** If you miss a pronunciation or a nuance, use a keyboard shortcut to instantly replay the segment.
4. **Continue:** Simply press **Space** to resume playback. Once you are ready, the video will play until the end of the next segment, where it will automatically pause again for analysis.

### 3. Essential Shortcuts

To stay in the "flow" without using the mouse, you can configure shortcuts in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` (see the [Keyboard Shortcuts guide](../user-manual/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for more details):

| Action               | Suggested Key | Usage                                            |
| :------------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Replay Segment**   | `Ctrl + R`    | Re-listen to the pronunciation or a tricky part. |
| **Previous Segment** | `Ctrl + J`    | Go back if you missed a line.                    |
| **Next Segment**     | `Ctrl + L`    | Move on once the current sentence is mastered.   |

By iterating over each segment with these tools, you can transform a simple video into a comprehensive, interactive language lesson.

## Tips for YouTube

- **Native Controls:** You can still use all native YouTube controls (J/K/L for seeking, space for pausing).
- **Miniplayer:** The extension is currently optimized for the standard and theater modes; the miniplayer might have limited visibility.
- **Auto-translate:** While YouTube offers its own auto-translate, Subtitle Insights' AI-powered translation is often more accurate for learners as it provides more context and grammatical depth.
