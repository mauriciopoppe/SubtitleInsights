# Watching on YouTube

YouTube is the primary platform for Subtitle Insights, offering the most integrated experience.

## Workflow

1. **Open a Video:** Navigate to any YouTube video with subtitles (CC).
2. **Enable Subtitles:** Make sure the native YouTube CC is turned ON.
3. **Toggle Insights:** The extension button will appear in the player's control bar (next to the settings gear). Click it to ensure the features you want (Overlay/Sidebar) are enabled.
4. **Interact:**
   - Watch the overlay for real-time translation.
   - Use the sidebar to review complex sentences.
   - Hover over the overlay to pause and digest a difficult line.

## Tips for YouTube

- **Native Controls:** You can still use all native YouTube controls (J/K/L for seeking, space for pausing).
- **Miniplayer:** The extension is currently optimized for the standard and theater modes; the miniplayer might have limited visibility.
- **Auto-translate:** While YouTube offers its own auto-translate, Subtitle Insights' AI-powered translation is often more accurate for learners as it provides more context and grammatical depth.
