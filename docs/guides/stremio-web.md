# Watching on Stremio Web

Subtitle Insights supports `web.stremio.com`, allowing you to apply AI analysis to your favorite movies and shows.

## Integration Details

- **Sidebar Positioning:** On Stremio, the sidebar is fixed to the right side of the screen.
- **Player Resizing:** The video player automatically shrinks to accommodate the sidebar when it is active, ensuring nothing is hidden.
- **Overlay:** The overlay works identically to the YouTube version, appearing directly over the Stremio player.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to [web.stremio.com](https://web.stremio.com) and start a video.
2. Select a subtitle track from the native Stremio subtitle menu.
3. The Subtitle Insights toggle will appear in the Stremio control bar.
4. Click the toggle to enable the Sidebar or Overlay.

## Known Limitations

- **Desktop Only:** Like all Chrome extension features, this requires a desktop browser.
- **Subtitle Capture:** Subtitles must be selected through the Stremio interface for the extension to capture them. If they are hardcoded into the video (burned-in), the extension cannot "read" them.
