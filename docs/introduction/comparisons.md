# Comparisons with other extensions

Subtitle Insights takes a distinct approach to language learning compared to established tools like **asbplayer** or **Language Reactor**. While those extensions are powerful for many use cases, this project focuses on a few specific areas to create a unique experience.

## Core Strengths

### 1. Private, Local AI

Most translation tools rely on external cloud services. Subtitle Insights does everything right on the device using Chrome's built-in AI. This means subtitle data stays local, and no text is ever sent to third-party servers for analysis.

### 2. Automated Insights

While many tools focus on individual word lookups, Subtitle Insights uses Gemini Nano to automatically analyze entire sentences. It provides concise explanations of complex language structures and cultural nuances in real-time, reducing the need for manual dictionary lookups.

### 3. Integrated Experience

The interface is designed to blend perfectly with the video player. It follows the native aesthetics of YouTube and Stremio, feeling like a natural feature of the platform rather than an added layer. Controls are unobtrusive and only appear when they are actually needed.

### 4. Personalized for Any Level

Insights are completely customizable through profiles. A beginner might want every word and particle explained in detail, while an advanced learner might prefer seeing specific examples of complex rules. The system prompt in the profile settings allows for fine-tuning the AI's output to match any learning preference.

### 5. Fast and Accessible

Processing everything locally eliminates server-side latency. Because the extension leverages built-in browser capabilities, there are no subscription fees, API keys, or cloud costs required to access high-quality translations and insights.
