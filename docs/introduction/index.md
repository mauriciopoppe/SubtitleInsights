# What is Subtitle Insights?

Subtitle Insights turns YouTube and Stremio videos into an interactive language learning playground. It uses the latest AI models built right into the Chrome browser to provide real-time translations and deep grammatical insights, all while keeping data private and on the device.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Private Local AI:** Leverages Chrome's built-in AI tools (Translator and Prompt APIs) to process all data locally on your device. Your data stays private and never leaves your browser.
- **Native Feel:** Designed to look and feel just like YouTube and Stremio, ensuring a seamless and distraction-free viewing experience.
- **Language Agnostic:** Supports multiple source and target languages for a versatile learning experience.

## How it Works

1. **Capture:** Subtitles can be captured automatically from the video player or uploaded manually for analysis.
2. **Translate:** Chrome's Translator API creates natural, context-aware translations for whatever is being said.
3. **Analyze:** Chrome's Prompt API (powered by Gemini Nano) breaks down complex sentences, explaining tricky grammar and cultural nuances.
4. **Present:** Results appear in a clean overlay on the video and a synchronized transcript in the sidebar.
