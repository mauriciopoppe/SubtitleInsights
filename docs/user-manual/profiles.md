# Profiles

Profiles allow for the customization of how the AI interacts with different languages and learning styles.

## Managing Profiles

The Profile Manager is accessible through the **Detailed Settings** link in the extension's popup menu.

- **Create Multiple Profiles:** Different profiles can be set up for different languages or learning goals (e.g., "Japanese (Default)", "Spanish Beginner").
- **Custom System Prompts:** Tailor the AI's focus and personality. The AI can be instructed to concentrate on specific grammar points, provide varying levels of detail, or use a specific tone.
- **Language Selection:** Define the source and target languages specifically for each profile.

## Customizing AI Behavior

The **System Prompt** field in the Profile Editor is the most powerful tool for customization. By adjusting the prompt, it is possible to:
- Instruct the AI to include Romaji/IPA for pronunciation.
- Request explanations tailored to specific levels (such as JLPT levels for Japanese).
- Control the length and complexity of the AI's explanations.
