# Sidebar

The sidebar provides a comprehensive view of the entire video transcript, allowing for easy review of past segments and a look at what's coming next.

## Smart Sidebar

- **Full Transcript:** Displays every captured subtitle segment with its original text and translation.
- **Active Highlighting:** The currently playing segment is automatically highlighted in the sidebar, making it easy to identify the current line.
- **Initial Positioning:** When the sidebar is first rendered, it automatically scrolls to the current segment to get things started.

## Sync Button

To avoid a distracting experience while watching, the sidebar does not continuously auto-scroll as the video plays. If the transcript has been scrolled to review a previous part, jumping back to the current time is simple:
1. Locate the **Sync Button** (target icon) in the sidebar header.
2. Clicking it will immediately scroll the sidebar back to the active segment.

## Interaction

- **Review at Your Own Pace:** The sidebar is perfect for scrolling back to re-read difficult sections or analyzing complex grammar without interrupting the video playback.
- **Copy Text:** Text can be selected and copied directly from the sidebar, which is great for creating flashcards or taking notes in other apps.
- **Timing Adjustment:** Hovering over a segment for 2 seconds reveals a sync icon that allows for global subtitle timing shifts. For more details on how this works, see the [Selecting Subtitles](/user-manual/selecting-subtitles) page.
